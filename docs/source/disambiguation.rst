|ip|_ (address)
-------------------

An Internet Protocol (|ip|_) address can be thought of as a computer postcode to help identify where a machine can be found, for the purposes of communicating to it; it is difficult to mail a letter without a postcode.

:local |section_ip| example\::

  ``192.168.1.1``

|port|_
-------

A computers |port|_ is usually associated with an |section_ip|. This |port|_ further specifies where specifically to communicate to. Following the post analogy the post code is the |section_ip|, but the house number is the |port|_. This analogy breaks down when we consider that each computer can and usually does have multiple |port|_\s in the thousands, so maybe the computer is a property tycoon with multiple homes that can be contacted.

  192.168.1.1 ``:22``
